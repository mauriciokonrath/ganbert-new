GHOST:ghostwriting In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925). The email correspondence also details how adding scientist David Kirkland to the study would “add credibility.” (MONGLY02145918) “Adding David Kirkland as a co-author to both review papers would add £14,000 (pounds Stirling) to the project, which split by 25 seems a fair investment,” writes Christophe Gustin(Monsanto EU) in a discussion about possible co-authors for glyphosate genotoxicity literature.David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes ata premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day(equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost ofthe combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland'sinvolvement. Given the growing number of questionable genotoxicity publications, in my mindthis is worth the addition cost.”

TOXIC:surfactants This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto hadused for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study wasever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogencity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG wasnot mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer summarizes the findings of Monsanto’s expert, Dr. James Parry: “Dr. Parry concluded on his evaluation of the four articles that glyphosate is capable of producing genotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism based upon the production of oxidative damage.” at *3.
TOXIC:surfactants This document, from 1999, contains email correspondence from between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer writes: “I will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time with the limited information we have on the situation.” at *2.
TOXIC:surfactants In 1999, Monsanto hired Dr. James M. Parry, professor at the University of Wales, to conduct an internal (and secret) safety review of glyphosate and the formulated product. In the beginning of the report, Dr. Parry identified as the first deficiency in the data: “No adequate in vitro clastogenicity data available for glyphosate formulations.” He, thus, recommends that Monsanto “provide comprehensive in vitro cytogenetic data on glyphosate formulations.” He also concludes, “My overall view is that if the reported genotoxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate formulations can be shown to be due to the production of oxidative damage then a case could be made that anygenetic damage would be thesholded...it may be necessary to consider the possibility ofsusceptible groups within the human population.”
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains email correspondence between several Monsanto colleagues discussing the fallout from Dr. James Parry’s report on glyphosate (MONGLY01314233). Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) writes: “right now the only person I think that can dig us out of this genotox hole is the Good Dr. Kier...I am concerned about leaving Perry [sp] out there with thisas the final project/his final impressions...” Stephen Wratten (Monsanto) asks whether Dr. Parry “ever worked with industry on this sort ofproject?” Later, Wratten intones that the Parry report is not useful for Monsanto: “I do not see thathe has stuck his neck out on anything at all controversial, and therefore, there is little value in thewrite-up as written that could be useful. Hope it didn't cost much...”
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains an email from William Heydens to Monsanto colleagues after reading the Parry report on glyphosate.

TOXIC:testing In this email correspondence, Richard Garnett (Monsanto EU), Lisa Flagg (Monsanto Global Product Quality Lead, Crop Protection) and others discuss storage testing of glyphosate. Specifically, the email comments on how long-term storage of glyphosate increases NNG levels. Bart Roose (Monsanto EU): “I would suggest we agree in writing that `bad results' of NNG due to accelerated ageing can be caused by the heat level and is therefore not representative for normalageing'.”
CHEMI:absorption This document contains a paper written by Mark Martens, Christophe Gustin and C. Bates on how the surfactants in Roundup formulations increase the absorption of glyphosate in the human skin. The paper includes the following passage: “Surfactants are able to increase glyphosate absorption through the skin by (1) removal of lipids(sebum) from the epidermal surface due to surfactant action, (2) increase of the hydration state ofthe skin (under closed exposure conditions), (3) increase of skin contact (spreading of waterdroplets by surfactant action), (4) increase of contact time with the skin due to decrease ofevaporation of water from the droplets containing surfactant (surfactant monolayer at surface ofdroplets slows down passage to vapour phase,) increase of sub epidermal blood flow due toirritant action of surfactant, (6) intraepidermal and sub epidermal intercellular water accumulationdue to the irritant action of the surfactant.”

CHEMI:absorption This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that throughoral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine...Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.”Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing ondermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.”The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is importantbecause Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimateglyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmirasand Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.
