UNK:UNK Here is our forecast
UNK:UNK Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet skis. Flying somewhere takes too much time.
UNK:UNK test successful. way to go!!!
UNK:UNK Randy, Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in the scheduling group. Plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made. (Patti S for example) Phillip
UNK:UNK Lets shoot for Tuesday at 11:45.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders. We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. Were getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation. Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project. Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan. Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions. Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems. Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day. Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options.

Investors Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. I will know more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W.

UNK:UNK Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000 01:09 PM ----- From: Phillip K Allen 09/28/2000 10:56 AM Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enrons belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal. Sincerely, Phillip Allen

Crocker <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment Structure STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80% to 95% of value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80% to 95% of value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

UNK:UNK Reagan, Just wanted to give you an update. I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings. At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing. Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid. Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts. Phillip

UNK:UNK Greg, Happy B-day. Email me your phone # and I will call you. Keith
UNK:UNK Kathy, Regarding the guest password for gas daily, can you please relay the information to Mike Grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at gas daily today. I will be out of the office on Friday. thank you Phillip
UNK:UNK John, Denvers short rockies position beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer transport. They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and 2005. They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday and Thursday. Phillip
UNK:UNK Jim, Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week? Can you make sure the gas desk is included. Phillip
UNK:UNK George, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner? What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans? Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made? By whom? What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process. Phillip
UNK:UNK Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 04:35 PM ----- George Richards <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: Phillip Allen <pallen@enron.com> cc: Larry Lewter <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC - Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
UNK:UNK George, Here sales numbers from Reagan: As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date. Let me know what you think. I will follow up with an email and phone call about Cherry Creek. I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the De Ville property. Phillip Allen
UNK:UNK Jeff, What is up with Burnet? Phillip
UNK:UNK Jeff, I need to see the site plan for Burnet. Remember I must get written approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided. I would also like to review the closing statements as soon as possible. Phillip
UNK:UNK Lucy, I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy of this file. You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct amounts and I will input.
UNK:UNK Brenda, I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on August 28th. I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845. I will go ahead and mail you another check. If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October. I know your concerns about the site plan. I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval. I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon. Phillip

This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.

UNK:UNK Jeff, I received the rent roll. I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I am booked with stage coach. I will drive by Friday evening. I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside. Can you find out when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price? What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal. Remember we have to get Brenda happy. Phillip
UNK:UNK 9/8 9/7 diff Socal 36,600 37,200 -600 NWPL -51,000 -51,250 250 San Juan -32,500 -32,000 -500 The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 9/8. This added 800 shorts to San Juan and 200 longs to Socal. Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and sold 800 Socal.
UNK:UNK why is aeco basis so low on the list? Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO? What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO?
UNK:UNK Jeff, You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which I might become involved with Creekside. Are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts? Is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue? Did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch? I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet. Phillip

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.

UNK:UNK Larry, Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities. I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were built by Reagan Lehmann. 22 Units were sold for around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180s. Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours? He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan. My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex. As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested. Call or email with your thoughts. Phillip

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the regions growing number of dot-coms. Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com. Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle. More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the Internet economy. It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites. Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security facilities. We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall, said Karl Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. That is the equivalent of six oil refineries. A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads. Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The tariff is designed to protect the companys existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each, Karzmar said. Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue. On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power -- represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures. Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate. These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads, said Bob Royer, director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light. The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts. With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space & Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the six-building complex to seven different co-location companies. It is probably the largest data center park in the country, boasts Laurent Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications, NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all lease space in the office park. After building Exodus first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country. As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in Seattle continues to escalate. But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California. Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management. We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space, said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in Seattle. The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed. It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth, said Seattle City Lights Royer. The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in a way.

UNK:UNK Richard, Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas Report. It shows 410. But again that might be just what the two utilities receive.

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team Selection information. Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form we sent you. The information needed is then easily transferred into the database directly from that Excel spreadsheet. If you do not have the ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still require additional information. We need each persons email address. Without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have each persons phone number, in the event we need to reach them. So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email. Thank you for your assistance Phillip. Christi L.

UNK:UNK Mark, Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal basis and socal/san juan spreads. I listed the days during bidweek that reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints before and after bidweek. The following observations can be made: July 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79 2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91 3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99 2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49 3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings 4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. Please call with any questions. Phillip
UNK:UNK Alan, You should have received updated numbers from Keith Holst. Call me if you did not receive them. Phillip
UNK:UNK Suzanne, Can you give me more details or email the plan prior to meeting? What do I need to provide besides headcount? Otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine Phillip
UNK:UNK Colleen, Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution. On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up? Phillip
UNK:UNK Brad, With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate. Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager. I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end. Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori. Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori. Let me know if there are any issues. Phillip
UNK:UNK Bruce, Can you stop by and set up my reuters. Phillip
UNK:UNK Lucy, The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. See if you can add these modifications: 1. Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It should read =c6+d6. Then copy this formula to the rows below. 2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6. 3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4. After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond. Phillip
UNK:UNK Lucy, I got your email with the attachment. Lets work together today to get this done Phillip
UNK:UNK you have my approval
UNK:UNK Lucy, We can discuss your email later. How is progress on creating the spreadsheets. You will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email. It is 2:00. I really want to make some progress on these two files. Phillip
UNK:UNK Lucy, Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week. Then email the file back.
UNK:UNK Open the utility spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1). You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months. If we have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper. Use the rates described in the spreadsheet. This is a great chance for you to practice excel.

UNK:UNK Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations: Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude 10 Total 81 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devils advocate? To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB? Thank you, Phillip

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works. I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions. The point of this meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those who are managing the books believe in the models results. Since I have heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss them. Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic operations. Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all the checks since Jan. 1.

They have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000. Could you give me a basis for the period : Sept -00 - May 31, 2006 Sept-00 - May 31, 2008 Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an adjustment to one of these point. Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread be on these terms. Thanks, Mike
UNK:UNK Wade, I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle situation. You need to take care of it this week. Lucy cant hold the tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) if the staff doesnt live up to it. If you decide to buy a small truck and you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your income. Phillip
UNK:UNK the merlin ct. address is still good. I dont know why the mailing would be returned.
UNK:UNK Tim, Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz. He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract. On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May. It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170. Also the second half of April doesnt seem to have panned out as I expected. The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary. Can you email or call with some additional insight? Thank you, Phillip

UNK:UNK Scott, I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company. I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him. Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider. Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. This is my best guess. I will get back to you with more. Phillip
UNK:UNK Lucy, I want to speak to Wade myself. He can call me at work or home. Or if you email me his number I will call him. I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance. I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office. Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays? I think I can guess your answer. I might stop by this Friday. Phillip

The WSCC data, which is dicey and we dont have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation. You are pulling scheduled. If someone doesnt schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they dont split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. Id like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story. Lets talk.

UNK:UNK Ned, Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value. The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year). Demand charges only. I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not. Please call or email with comments. Phillip Allen

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday. This might be more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments. We can adjust office hours on another day. Phillip
UNK:UNK Jeff, I will respond to the offer on Monday. There is a $35 Million expansion adding 250 jobs in Burnet. I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre. Owner financing would still work. Do you have an opinion? Phillip
UNK:UNK Al, I was glad to hear from you. I hope we can put the past behind us. Sounds like you have been busy. Congratulations on the new baby. Judging from your email all is well with you. Thats great. We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace). Three is it for us. Whats your target? The other two are doing well. Soccer, T-ball, and bike riding keeps them busy. They could use some of Coles coordination. My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now. I am just on maintenance. You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist. We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months. He never misses, rain or shine. Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays. Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road. I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday. I would like to hear more about your new job. Maybe we could grab lunch sometime. Phillip
UNK:UNK Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000 01:32 PM ----- From: Colleen Sullivan 05/30/2000 09:18 AM To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Transport p&l Phillip-- Ive noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange to me. Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but Ill point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so Ill know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and Ill take care of it.. On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019. (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.) Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin ($182,030) 139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora ($ 4,024) 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin ($ 8,271) 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin ($ 38,705) 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield ($ 1,988) Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP-Kingsgate. Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in case theres something you want to do about it. The columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. Deal # 251327 159540 265229 106300 201756 P&L $29,503 ($15,960) ($3,199) ($2,769) ($273) Rec: Ques/Clay Basin/0184 NWPL/Opal 543 NWPL/Opal Sumas NWPL/S of Gr Rvr Del: NWPL/S of Green River/Clay Ques/Clay Basin/0852 Ques/Clay Basin/0852 Ques/Clay Basin Ques/Clay Basin 1 329 8,738 2 1,500 3 2,974 11,362 4 6,741 12,349 1,439 5 19,052 3,183 9 333 13 30,863 2,680 14 30,451 15 35,226 16 6,979 235 17 17,464 18 9,294 20 10,796 771 21 17,930 22 10,667 23 14,415 9,076 25 23,934 8,695 26 3,284 27 1,976 28 1,751 29 1,591 30 20,242
UNK:UNK Mary, If we add both balances together the total is $1,140. I can spread it over 6 or 12 months. 6 month payout would be $190/month. 12 month payout would be $95/month. Your choice. I would like it if you could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so. Does $10/hr sound fair? We can apply it to the loan. Phillip

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti- price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps.

They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product. As to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities. We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we implement our strategy in California. Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach? Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGAs and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird
